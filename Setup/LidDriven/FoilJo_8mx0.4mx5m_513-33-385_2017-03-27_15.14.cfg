# Output formats.  Output formats can be combined by giving one line per type.
# Supported format types are:
#    Matrix          display values on the screen
#    DataFile        writes data to an ASCII file with .dat suffix
#    Binary          writes a single binary file using MPI-IO with a .bin
#                       suffix
#    PBinary         writes parallel binary files using MPI-IO with a .bin
#                       suffix
#    VTK             Visualization Toolkit Image file (.vti)
#    PVTK            Parallel VTK Image file (.pvti and .vti). Number of vti
#                       files generated is the same as the number of GPUs.
#    HDF5_Multiple   Write out heavy data in HDF5 format with XDMF files for
#                       visualization software. Produces multiple HDF5 files,
#                       one for each time step.
#
# Multiple output formats can be requested (e.g. both Matrix and VTK). The
